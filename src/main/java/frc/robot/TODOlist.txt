This is a short-term TODO list

For 03/08:

Check the climber arm speed
Check the right climber arm direction
Check the encoders of both climber arms
Check the auto-shoot sequence (shoot without a ball, but check that the whole sequence goes from beginning to end)

Create Phoenixvision feed on SmartDashboard
Check why PhoenixVision does not output on Driver Station (or connect direct camera feed there)

Look at the autonomous rooutine
