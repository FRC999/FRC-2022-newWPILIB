Phase/inversion for climber motors, assign to the right buttons
Check that the plunger-out button is working on bottom-yellow button
Talk to the drivers re: new button assignments and safety/command cancel

For 03/10:

*** High Priority

Measure kEncoderCPR (line 111 in Constants) to check the driving distance per 1 ft
*** Test 1-ball limelight auto command

Add the plunger out to on DisabledInit, and check that plunger in on Teleop init
Limelight auto routine


For 03/08:

+++++ Create Phoenixvision feed on SmartDashboard
