This is a short-term TODO list

For 03/09:

Check the autonomous routine
Add the plunger out to on DisabledInit, and check that plunger in on Teleop init


For 03/08:

*** High Priority
++++ Ask Nolan to solder wires in the buttonbox
Talk to drivers re: what to do if you're stuck either with the intake or with the shooter or plunger

*** Regular priority

++++ Check the climber arm speed
++++ Check the right climber arm direction
++++ Check the encoders of both climber arms
++++ Check the auto-shoot sequence (shoot without a ball, but check that the whole sequence goes from beginning to end)

+++++ Create Phoenixvision feed on SmartDashboard
+++++ Check why PhoenixVision does not output on Driver Station (or connect direct camera feed there)
++   Reorganize icons on the SmartDashboard

Look at the autonomous rooutine

+++++ Get the 90 degree USB-C and connect to the roborio, 2nd monitor and other place

Talk to drivers re: setup/cleanup procedure

Add commands to interrupt drive, shooter, intake, climber subsystems
    * done but not binded to a button
